# xinzhu-schedule-clock
An application for Xinzhu Middle School that can display time and class schedules

> [!NOTE]
> There is a story behind the creation of this app...
> 
> Because the clock in our class was broken, we had no idea what time it was during class, so the initial time display function came into being. Later, based on my classmates' suggestions, I added the class schedule display. After two months of testing and modifications, it finally became what I had in mind.
> 
> However, there is currently a major issue: this app tends to block the text on the PPT, which is a problem I will solve in the future.
>
> I hope someone can help me solve this problem...
